    hile working as a staff artist at the Ocean Institute, Hillenburg entertained plans to return eventually to college
    for a master's degree in art. Before this could materialize, he attended an animation festival, which inspired him
    to make a slight change in course. Instead of continuing his education with a traditional art program, Hillenburg
    chose to study experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts.[30] His thesis film, Wormholes, is
    about the theory of relativity.[35] It was screened at festivals, and at one of these, Hillenburg met Joe Murray,
    creator of the popular Nickelodeon animated series, Rocko's Modern Life. Murray was impressed by the style of the
    film and offered Hillenburg a job.[35][36] Hillenburg joined the series as a director and later, during the fourth
    season, he took on the roles of producer and creative director.
